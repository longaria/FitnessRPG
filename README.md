# FitnessRPG

# Project Description:
 
'FitnessRPG' was a Bachelors Thesis Project, in which the idea of using Gamification in a Fitness Center Context was explored in order to motivate its members to exercise more often and more consistently.

Gamification: The use of Gaming Elements (like badges, points, achievments, sense of progression, competition etc.) in a non-gaming context for motivational purposes.


The project consists of a classical RPG game developed in Unity for Mobile Phones and Windows.
 
It contains virtual resources called 'Activity Points' (AP) that are tied to the activity and participation in a (physical) gym.

AP are required to progress in the game by challenging monsters, acquiring experience points, loot etc.
 
AP are earned by booking courses on the website of a fitness center.
