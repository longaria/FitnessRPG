# FitnessRPG

# Project Description:

Gamification: The use of Gaming Elements (like badges, points, achievments, sense of progression, competition etc.) in a non-gaming context for motivational purposes.

It contains virtual resources called 'Activity Points' (AP) that are tied to the activity and participation in a (physical) gym.
